		"Comment": "Today's movements groves at massive scale but sometimes lack the depth to bring any sustained changes. Using social media and technology helps us organize at large, but may disconnect us from the old school meetings and discussions over long periods of time which leads to collective thinking and decision making. 'You need both twitter and tea without sugar.'"
